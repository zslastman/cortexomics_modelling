# Cortexomics - kinetic modeling

This github contains code and some data for the kinetic modeling in the 'cortexomics' project - in which protein expression trajectories (Mass Spec) are being modelled as a function of synthesis (measured by Ribo-seq) and degredation.


Currently the key document is src/R/Modelling/run_degmodel_dropout.Rmd. This should run independently given the files in the github, and the appropriate libraries.

This should run in rstudio - some of the plots don't seem to want to  go into the html report, so you may need to re-run it.
